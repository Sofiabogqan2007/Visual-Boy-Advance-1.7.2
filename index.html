<p>This software is an emulator that allows you to play gameboy color games on your home/school computer without admin rights at all!</p>
<h2 id="game-file-opening">Game File Opening</h2>
<p>some of you may know that i included one game into the emulator that i copied into github. well, in order to open your downloaded gameboy color games, you need to copy them into this emulaotor. make sure that your game file name contains .gbc at the end of it and maybe then, it will show up in here. you can keep your game name that has .sav in it just in case itâ€™s required just like i did with my one game.
